TODO:
Add a "Start" component and incorporate a timeline prop to move from start to shipPlacement

Notes for future:
For ShipPlacement, have a "begin" button that is invisible unless the player has placed all of their ships. Also, have a reset button. (Maybe double-check with the player before resetting?)
